# Machine Learning Classification and Clustering Repository

This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks and dataset focused on both classification and clustering tasks using various machine learning algorithms. The key algorithms implemented include Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB) for classification, and k-means for clustering.
